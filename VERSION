CHANGELOG
---------
- v0.11 from Aug 10th, 2021, added functions tSw and wSw
  to simplify the process of asking for engineering questions.
  Removed the following lines from the README:
  Running `make pdf` again will produce another test replacing `out_units4school.pdf` (containing answers). Run this as many times as you like until you find a suitable test, but you may as well take the first one.
  Then run `make print` to produce a printable A4 page without solutions. This will only convert the current test to a print-friendly version without the answers.

- v0.10 from Aug  8th, 2021, saved as -b-
  To every row there will be one question only. 
  Added two questiontypes to the prefixes.

- v0.08 from Jul 31st, 2020
  The program has been in use for a full year now. I have added documentation for 
  the routines in 'questions.R'.
- v0.07  
  Supply a branch with csv-files just in case LibreOffice is missing.  
  Updated README, now with a CHANGELOG section and correct markdown markup.
- v0.06  
  Added a class definition `units4school`.  
  Fixed the `print` routine to prevent new questions.  
  Makefile now contains a `make test` to check installation.
- v0.05  
  First upload to github  
  Now with a `summary.pdf` with all the data summarized and an ple.
- v0.04 from Jan 3rd, 2019
  Working attempt number one

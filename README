Questions from three different topics:

 + physical constants



PREREQUISITES
-------------

The following software is required to run units4school:
	R, sed, OpenOffice, pdflatex

To check if you have the software installed run in a terminal:
	R --version
	pdflatex --version
and
	soffice --help
	sed

Download and install `R` from 
	https://www.r-project.org/
The program `sed` should have shipped with your Linux or Mac.
Then `pdflatex` is part of any standard LaTeX distribution, check 
	https://www.latex-project.org/
It will be necessary to restart the computer after installing TeX, even with MacTeX on a Macintosh computer.
At last, `soffice` is the command line tool of LibreOffice. On a Linux machine it is available after installing LibreOffice. On Mac you will have to specify the full path to its binary. For example on my machine (Mac OS 10.10) this is:
	/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice
For some reason the conversion utility of OpenOffice does not work (version 4.1.6). The problem is that Apache's OpenOffice's `soffice` comes without the command-line option --convert-to. Use LibreOffice instead, or tell me how to do it with OpenOffice.



USAGE
-----
